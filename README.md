#  Teacher–Student Login Portal

A fully responsive **Teacher–Student Management System** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It simulates a real-world dashboard where teachers can manage student records and students can access their own academic information — all handled on the client side with no external database.

##  Project Overview

The portal offers two distinct dashboards:

- **Teacher Dashboard:**  
  Teachers can log in, add or edit student profiles, update attendance, record grades, and monitor payments.

- **Student Dashboard:**  
  Students can securely log in to view their academic progress, attendance, grade average, and announcements shared by teachers.

The project demonstrates UI design, form validation, and dynamic JavaScript data manipulation using Local Storage.
